# gentoolchain.sh - Briko Build System's Toolchain Generator

`gentoolchain.sh` is a script that will compile an independent musl-libc toolchain using the host system's gcc and libraries.<br>

The toolchain used to be generated by the main build script `stela.sh`, but with the amount of bloat it carried, it was rewritten. Now it is divided into three parts. The first part is `gentoolchain.sh`, which is in charge of generating the toolchain used to compile StelaLinux Packages. The next is `briko.sh` which is the intermediate script that uses the generated toolchain to compile packages for StelaLinux. Finally is `lpm`, the Linligno Package Manager, that will be an executable on StelaLinux systems as the package manager.<br>

**This script is for advanced Linux powerusers, and should not be used for daily and production-ready use in its current state!**

## Commands:
`./gentoolchain.sh x86_64-musl/i686-musl`<br>
Generates a musl-libc toolchain for target x86_64 or i686.<br>

`./gentoolchain.sh clean`<br>
Cleans the toolchain environment. Can add `--keep-archives` flag to not delete source archives.<br>
