# Midstreams (natickOS's sysV-like Init Scripts)
Midstreams started as starINIT, which was heavily based off of the init scripts used by Minimal Linux Live, but after being exposed to its OverlayFS, I wanted to find a more traditional way of storing files. So after looking at several Linux Distribution's init files (Devuan, Gentoo, etc.) I rewrote it in a similar fashion to the current itteration of Midstreams (previously Xiongnu and MuroINIT) found today. StelaLinux and its various componients have been rewritten dozens of times, but I hope to keep this one stable.

* Required Root (/) Directories
